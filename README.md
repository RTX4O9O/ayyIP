## a java tool that helps you to find the ip of the server you rent

I have encountered several instances where I rented Minecraft servers, but due to some reasons, the IP address of the server host was not clearly marked. Asking the customer service of the hosting provider would take extra time, so I decided to create this program. All you need to do is confirm which jar file the server runs on by default when booting up, and then temporarily replace it with the released jar file to disguise it as the server jar. After that, start the host, and you will be able to see the server's IP address displayed!

I developed this project in just 10 minutes. If you wish to add any features or have any suggestions, please feel free to let me know. Otherwise, I probably won't come back to enhance this project further.
